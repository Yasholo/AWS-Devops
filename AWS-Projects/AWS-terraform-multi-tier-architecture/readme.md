## 🔰 Overview

This project aims to deploy a multi-tier architecture on AWS, consisting of three tiers: the Presentation Layer (Web Tier), the Application Layer, and the Data Layer (Database Tier). Each tier will be deployed using Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and management. Terraform involves structuring infrastructure into modular layers, each responsible for specific tasks such as networking, security, load balancing, auto-scaling, database management, and monitoring. This approach ensures scalability, security, and maintainability. This article provides a comprehensive guide on setting up a multi-tier architecture using Terraform, covering all aspects from directory structure to deployment and future enhancements.

1. **Web Tier**:

Serves as the entry point for user requests.

2. **Application Tier**:

It contains the application's core logic and processing capabilities and handles business logic, processing user requests, and generating responses. Interacts with the Web Tier and Database Tier.

3. **Database Tier**:

Stores and manages application data persistently. Ensures data integrity, consistency, and durability through backups and replication.

*It's the basic plan of this project to create these tiers. Resulting in a Multi-Tier-Project helping us to eficciently run our applications. We will be using a high standard terraform module approach in this project. (you won't find web, app or database module but a variety of other modules which will be creating all these instances for us)*


## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: You need an active AWS account to provision resources and services on the AWS cloud platform.

- **AWS Access Credentials**: Obtain AWS access credentials with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources. This involves creating an IAM user with programmatic access and attaching policies that grant necessary permissions.

- **Terraform Installed**: Install Terraform on your local machine or development environment. 
You can follow this [article on terraform installation](https://medium.com/@Yasholo/terraform-a-guide-ff06bd539040).

- **AWS CLI Installed and Configured**: Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your machine and configure it with your AWS access credentials. This allows Terraform to interact with AWS services on your behalf. 
You can follow this [article on AWS CLI Installation.](https://medium.com/@Yasholo/aws-command-line-interface-cli-install-and-configure-8e70e6831074).

- And lastly some basic knowledge of AWS services (VPC, EC2, RDS, ALB, CloudWatch) and Terraform.

## 🌟 Objective

- **Modularity:** Utilize Terraform modules to encapsulate each tier's components, enabling reusability and maintainability.

- **Scalability:** Implement Auto Scaling Groups to dynamically scale resources based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

- **High Availability:** Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to enhance fault tolerance and maintain continuous availability.

- **Security:** Utilize AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), security groups, and encryption mechanisms to enforce data security and compliance.

- **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrate AWS CloudWatch for monitoring resource utilization, application performance, and operational metrics.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Implement infrastructure deployment and management using Terraform, enabling version-controlled, repeatable, and consistent infrastructure configurations.


## 🌠 Key Features and Components:

### [Networking](./modules/network/)

## ⚙️ Terraform Configuration Files
Tip: You can follow the [official terraform aws documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs) if you ever get stuck while setting up your resources. (use the search bar to get information about a particular object.)

### 🧮 Root Module Files

The root module serves as the entry point for your Terraform configuration and includes the primary files that define the overall structure and components of your infrastructure. Here's an in-depth look at each of the root module files:

**main.tf** [🔗](./main.tf): 

* **Purpose**: This file is the core of your Terraform configuration. It specifies the provider details and calls various modules to set up different parts of the infrastructure.
* **Components**:

    * **Provider Configuration**: Defines the cloud provider (e.g., AWS) to be used and sets up credentials, regions, and other settings.
    * **Module Calls**: Invokes various modules to create resources such as network, security groups, load balancers, auto-scaling groups, databases, and monitoring.

**variables.tf** [🔗](./variables.tf): 

* **Purpose**: Contains all the variable definitions used throughout the Terraform configuration. These variables allow for customizable input values without hardcoding them in the configuration files.
* **Components**:

    * **Variable Declarations**: Defines variables with descriptions, types, and default values (if any). This helps in making the Terraform configuration flexible and reusable.

**outputs.tf** [🔗](./outputs.tf):

* **Purpose**: Defines the output values from the root module. These outputs can be used to display important information after the infrastructure is provisioned or to pass values between modules.
* **Components**:

    * **Output Declarations**: Specifies the values to be output after the deployment, such as IDs and ARNs of created resources.

**terraform.tfvars** [🔗](./terraform.tfvars):

* **Purpose**: Provides the actual values for the variables defined in variables.tf. This file is used to set specific values for different environments or configurations without altering the main configuration files.
* **Components**:

    * **Variable Assignments**: Assigns values to the variables declared in '**variables.tf**', allowing for environment-specific configurations.
