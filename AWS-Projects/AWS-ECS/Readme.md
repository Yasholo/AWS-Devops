# Pushing Docker Images from Local Machine to AWS â€“ ECR

In this project, we'll learn how to push Docker images from your local machine to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). AWS ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.


## Step 1: Create an ECR Repository

AWS uses a token-based authentication system to manage Docker access to ECR.
