# AWS CloudWatch

CloudWatch is a service that monitors activities of resources and applicationson AWS cloud. You can consider it as a Gatekeeper or a Watchman for AWS Cloud. It allows users to collect and track metrics, monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in AWS resources. CloudWatch provides a unified view of AWS resources and applications, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot issues in real-time.

For example, if you create an EC2 instance or upload some content on S3 bucket or you are interacting with any of the services on AWS. You can find all these activities logged on AWS CloudWatch, you can also ask CloudWatch to tell you about all the activities that took place when you were not around.

### Primary Features of CloudWatch:

    1. Metrics Monitoring: CloudWatch allows you to collect and monitor metrics from various AWS services, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Lambda functions, and more. These metrics provide insights into the performance, health, and utilization of your resources.

    2. Logs Monitoring: CloudWatch Logs enables you to collect, monitor, and analyze log files from your applications and AWS services. You can use CloudWatch Logs to search and filter log data, create metrics and alarms based on log events, and gain operational insights into your applications.

    3. Alarms and Notifications: CloudWatch Alarms allow you to set up alarms on metrics to trigger notifications or automated actions when certain thresholds are met. You can receive notifications via email, SMS, SNS (Simple Notification Service), or trigger automated actions using AWS Lambda.

    4. Dashboards: CloudWatch Dashboards enable you to create customized dashboards to visualize your metrics and monitor the health and performance of your AWS resources and applications in a single view.

    5. Events and Automation: CloudWatch Events allow you to respond to changes in your AWS environment by triggering automated actions in response to events. You can use CloudWatch Events to schedule automated tasks, trigger AWS Lambda functions, or integrate with other AWS services.
